========================

What time is needed, sorting different counts of numbers in different ways of using threads for the program?

This project discovers how threading influences performance of simple algorithms like Mergesort algorithm. Besides that the effort will be documented what needs to be done to make a program run with multiple threads w/o using frameworks. Maybe some tests will be done using Java 8 later on.

Inspired by Robert C. Martin's (et al.) Clean Code, 2009, Pearson Education, Inc, chapter "Concurrency".
