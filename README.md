========================

Discovery on how threading influences performance of simple algorithms like Mergesort algorithm. Besides that the effort will be documented what needs to be done to make a program run with multiple threads w/o using frameworks. Maybe some tests will be done using Java 8 later on.

What time is needed, sorting different counts of numbers in different ways of using threads for the program?
